<html>
    <head>
        
    </head>

    </body>
</html>
# 2. Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in HTML document?
ans:- In HTML, comments are used to add notes or explanations to the code that are not visible to the user when the page is rendered in a web browser.
 The purpose of comments is to:
1. Explain the code: Comments can help other developers understand the purpose of a particular section of code or how it works.
2. Debugging: Comments can be used to temporarily disable a section of code for testing or debugging purposes.
3. Organization: Comments can be used to separate sections of code or to highlight important parts of the code.

Here's an example of how to use comments in an HTML document:

<!-- This is a comment in HTML -->

<html>
<head>
<title>Example Page</title>
</head>
<body>
<!-- This is a comment that spans multiple lines
and can be used to explain a section of code -->
<h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
<!-- <p>This paragraph is commented out and will not be visible</p> -->
</body>
</html>

In this example, the comments are denoted by the <!-- and --> symbols. Anything written between these 
symbols will be ignored by the web browser and will not be displayed on the page.
# 3. Write an HTMl program  that includes a heading , a paragraph of text,a horizental line,and a line break.
arrange these elements to create a simple web page layout?
Ans:- Here is an HTML program that includes a heading, a paragraph of text, a horizontal line, and a line break:


<html>
<head>
	<title>Simple Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
	<!-- Heading -->
	<h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
	
	<!-- Horizontal Line -->
	<hr>
	
	<!-- Paragraph of Text -->
	<p>This is a simple web page layout. I hope you find it helpful!</p>
	
	<!-- Line Break -->
	<br>
	
	<!-- Additional Text -->
	<p>This is another paragraph of text.</p>
</body>
</html>


This HTML program will create a simple web page layout with the following elements:

- A heading (<h1>) at the top of the page
- A horizontal line (<hr>) below the heading
- A paragraph of text (<p>) below the horizontal line
- A line break (<br>) below the paragraph of text
- Another paragraph of text (<p>) below the line break

When rendered in a web browser, this HTML program will display a simple web page with a clear and readable layout.
# 4. Write a short note on Tag and element with an example ?
ans:- Tag and Element:

In HTML, a tag is a keyword surrounded by angle brackets (< and >), used to define the start and end of an element. 
An element is the combination of a start tag, content, and an end tag.

Example:

<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>

- <p> is the start tag (opening tag)
- This is a paragraph of text. is the content
- </p> is the end tag (closing tag)

Together, they form the <p> element, which represents a paragraph of text.

Note:

- Start tags are used to indicate the beginning of an element.
- End tags are used to indicate the end of an element, and are denoted by a forward slash (/) before the tag name.
- Some elements, like <br>, are self-closing and do not require an end tag.
# 5. What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML ?
Ans:- The DOCTYPE Declaration, also known as the Document Type Declaration, is the first line of code in an HTML document. 
It tells the web browser which version of HTML is being used, and it's essential for ensuring that the browser renders the page correctly.

The DOCTYPE Declaration typically looks like this:

<!DOCTYPE html>

This declaration tells the browser that the document is written in HTML5, which is the latest version of HTML.

Other examples of DOCTYPE Declarations include:

- <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"> (HTML 4.01 Transitional)
- <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"> (XHTML 1.0 Strict)

The DOCTYPE Declaration serves several purposes:

1. Versioning: It specifies the version of HTML being used.
2. Validation: It helps validators check the document's syntax and structure.
3. Browser rendering: It tells the browser to render the page in standards mode, rather than quirks mode.

In summary, the DOCTYPE Declaration is a crucial part of an HTML document,
 as it ensures that the browser understands the document's structure and renders it correctly.
